## Types of software testing

- Unit Testing - testing small units in **isolation**
- Integration Testing - testing a set of units which work together.
- Functional/Scenario Testing - test application as a whole against requirements or scenarios.
- Performance Testing
- Stress Testing - to find out where it breaks.

## Test Driven Development
- Devlioment methodology where you write test files first.
- Make sure they fail.
- Then write the actual (production) code to make the tests pass.
- Rationale being we hopefully know or have some idea of what the code should cover.

## Code Coverage

- It's a code quality metric.
- Which says what percentage of my code is being **exercised** by tests.
- Or IOW how much of my code is being run by my tests.
- High coverage (e.g. 90%) doesn't mean 90% of my code is well tested.

## What makes a bad test?

- Intermittently failing ones.
- Slow tests.
- Tests dependent on things outside your control.
- Test dependent on each other or a particular order of execution.
- Tests which don't test anything.
