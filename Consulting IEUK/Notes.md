- Timelines for completion.
- Key milestones of when things will be delivered
- Stakeholders what is is going on in a project
- Any interdependicies between activies
- The critical path - what is the minimum time something will take
- Governance arrangements

## RACI

- R: Responsible (who is gonna be doing the doing) - "the doer"
- A: Accountable (who makes the decision of when the doing is done) - "the Buck stops here"
- C: Consulted (which roles need to be asked about/involved in the activity) - "in the Loop"
- I: Informed - "kept in the picture"

### Best Practice
- For each activity, at least one person responsible.
- You should ideally onl have one person accountable for a particular activity.
- Too many people being informed or consulted could be inefficient and slow down the acitivity.
- Inform people of their roles and responsibility.
- Ensure those accountable have the authority to do so.
- Ensure toles do not have too many responsibilities.
